## 🌈 Hey there, I'm [Your Name] 👋
I'm a curious Computer Science student on a quest for my Bachelor's degree and the perfect cup of coffee ☕. I’m especially into frontend development, web wizardry, and making the internet a more accessible place for everyone—because good design should include everyone, not just the lucky few.

### 🧠 My brain is currently full of:

- HTML, S/CSS, JavaScript (and a slight obsession with clean UI)

- React, Next.js, and late-night bug fixing

### 🔍 Currently exploring:

- ARIA roles like it’s a role-playing game

- TypeScript (because types are friends, not enemies)

- Web performance (fast sites = happy users)

💬 Always down to chat about inclusive design, cool UI ideas, or why your div really doesn’t need that many classes.

# 🌈 Hey there, I'm Sophia 👋
I'm a curious Computer Science student on a quest for my Bachelor's degree and the perfect cup of coffee ☕. I’m especially into frontend development, web wizardry, and making the internet a more accessible place for everyone—because good design should include everyone, not just the lucky few.

- 👩🏼‍💻 Working on UX, React, Typescript and Web Accessibility
- 🧠 Currently learning Advanced Typescript and peaking into Backend technologies
- 👀 Looking forward to improving my knowledge on automization and performance optimization
- 🥅 2025 Goals: Completing my Bachelor Degree
- ✨ Fun fact: I love a well-made flat white coffee und summer night strolls

### 👩🏼‍💻 Currently focus:

- 🤓FrontendMentor challenges
- 👩🏼‍💻 Revamping my portfolio
- 🎓 Completing Uni courses
- 🔮 Losing track of my exponentially growing Obsidian wiki


💬 Always down to chat about inclusive design, cool UI ideas, or why your div really doesn’t need that many classes.
